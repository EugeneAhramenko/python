Create a function called username_generator take two inputs, first_name and last_name and returns a username.
The username should be a slice of the first three letters of their first name and the first four letters
of their last name.
If their first name is less than three letters or their last name is less than four letters it should
use their entire names.
For example, if the employeeâ€™s name is Abe Simpson the function should generate the username AbeSimp.
