 Review Loops:
 1. Create a list called single_digits that consists of the numbers 0-9 (inclusive).
 2. Create a for loop that goes through single_digits and prints out each one.
 3. Inside the loop that iterates through single_digits, append the squared value of each element of single_digits to
 the list squares.
 4. Create the list cubes using a list comprehension on the single_digits list. Each element of cubes should be
 an element of single_digits taken to the third power.
